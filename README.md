# Bizzare-Buzz
This website is for a competition being held at a school. The competition is about stock trading where you have 5 rounds and some companies. The prices change for each company after every round. Also there are a list of rumours for every round which might or might not be true. Since the competition will be under supervision all the values are just hard-coded.
